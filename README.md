# Group Project Backend Readme

**Each member of the group** must provide code for the backend.

We built a basic backend that allows us to maintain user generated posts in multiple collections. We enabled FULL CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) on our backend for two of the three models.

## Introduction

- The back end was relatively simple for us to build given Matt's experience with databases.
- We built models to house a full blog post that can be generated from a front end application OR something like Postman.
- We built a normal post form model that allows us to generate content anonomously from the front end application or postman. However, we took this opportunity to use the front end to manipulate and handle the data CRUD.

## The Planning Process

- We knew we wanted to build an application that relied on user generated data, so our models were not reliant on a pre-established database that we had to rely on. This gave us the flexibility to model and seed our test data in a way that we prefered.
- Given Matt's previous experience and comfortability with the backend portion, he focused heavily on building out the database.

## The Git Workflow

- We used a centralized git workflow to manage the backend? Matt managed the git repo, merging, etc of this build.
- We learned heavily from the front end repo, so that prevented a bunch of pain on the back end repo management.
